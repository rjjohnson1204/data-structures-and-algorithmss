### Merge
 
 In this Code Challenge we are to merge two linked list, similar to how a jacket zipper is zipped together.


## Challenge

The challenge is to create a method that merges the two linked list in an alternating fashion, maintaining order, and return a single linked list. 


##Approach & Efficiency 

Big O seems to be fairly straight forward as it is one simple operation that occurs X number of times which requires little space.
Time -> O(n)
Space -> 0(1)

##Solution 

Conceptualy I think we comprehend the operation that is to occur but the terminology and code execution is still a bit foggy.

update: worked with Phil and it did kind of clear some things up with the terminology as for as how it works but the coding is far beyond me at this point.



##Here is an image of what the game displays when there is a winner.
