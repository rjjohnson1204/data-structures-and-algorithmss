### Merge
 
 In this Code Challenge we are to merge two linked list, similar to how a jacket zipper is zipped together.


## Challenge

The challenge is to create a method that merges the two linked list in an alternating fashion, maintaining order, and return a single linked list. 


##Approach & Efficiency 

Big O seems to be fairly straight forward as it is one simple operation that occurs X number of times which requires little space.
Time -> O(n)
Space -> 0(1)

##Solution 

Conceptualy I think we comprehend the operation that is to occur but the terminology and code execution is still a bit foggy.



##Here is an image of what the game displays when there is a winner.
